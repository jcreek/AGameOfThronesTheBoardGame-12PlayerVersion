# A Game Of Thrones The Board Game - 12 Player Version

A 12 player version of the 'A Game Of Thrones The Board Game', [originally made by reddit user u/moaeater of Melbourne](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dp5haj/spoilers_main_hey_guys_i_made_a_12_player_got/) and their friends while at university. It was shared via [Onedrive](https://onedrive.live.com/?redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL2YvcyFBaWsza3BScURPSFpnLUVBREdaX0hsMWVYaEdHZVE&id=D9E10C6A94923729%2161568&cid=D9E10C6A94923729) with incomplete files and unclear instructions. This repo includes all the additional 3D models I created, as well as clear instructions so you too can create this unofficial expansion for the game.

I created this repo while going through the process of trying to produce this to be played as part of a Stag Do for which I was Best Man, and thought it may be helpful to others.

I have never read nor seen Game of Thrones, so I apologize if any of the models I have created are inaccurate or not in line with the source material. Please feel free to submit Pull Requests with any corrections or improvements.
