# A Game Of Thrones The Board Game - 12 Player Version

A 12 player version of the 'A Game Of Thrones The Board Game', [originally made by reddit user u/moaeater of Melbourne](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dp5haj/spoilers_main_hey_guys_i_made_a_12_player_got/) and their friends while at university. It was shared via [Onedrive](https://onedrive.live.com/?redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL2YvcyFBaWsza3BScURPSFpnLUVBREdaX0hsMWVYaEdHZVE&id=D9E10C6A94923729%2161568&cid=D9E10C6A94923729) with incomplete files and unclear instructions. This repo includes all the additional 3D models I created, as well as clear instructions so you too can create this unofficial expansion for the game.

I created this repo while going through the process of trying to produce this to be played as part of a Stag Do for which I was Best Man, and thought it may be helpful to others.

The manufacturers of the base board game shared a 23 minute [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0XRVTacNxI&ab_channel=FantasyFlightGames), which is significantly easier to use to learn the game than the written rules.

I have never read nor seen Game of Thrones, so I apologize if any of the models I have created are inaccurate or not in line with the source material. Please feel free to submit Pull Requests with any corrections or improvements.

Here is the original creator's description:

> Worked on it back in 2015 (the beginning of the end, really) when I was at University and the popularity for the game got out of hand.
>
> With the helps of some really talented and helpful students we were able to create an attractive and balanced edition to the game.
>
> I have added the following houses:
>
> - Night's Watch (they now take part in Realmly affairs)
> - Stark (as at start of show, cause I like Ned)
> - Greyjoy
> - Lannister
> - Baratheon
> - Tyrell
> - Martell
> - House of Black and White
> - Blackfyre
> - Targaryen
> - Dothraki
> - Qarth
>
> All play very much to the tune of the characters involved, while still retaining some balance (Dothraki start on an island for balance).
>
> P.S sorry Littlefinger fans, couldn't find a house to put him in.

## Tips

Here are some tips from the [original creator](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/dp5oqq/not_sure_if_the_game_of_thrones_board_game_is/).

> Don't start a game unless about 2/3 have played.
>
> Hard rule: 1 minute planning phases for the first 5 rounds. 3 minute planning phases for last 5.
>
> One player is banker. One player reads cards etc.
>
> Just trust people to resolve the cards at the start of the round.
>
> Keeps the game around 90 minutes-2 hours.
