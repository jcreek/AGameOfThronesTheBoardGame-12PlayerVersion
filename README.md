# AGameOfThronesTheBoardGame-12PlayerVersion
A 12 player version of the 'A Game Of Thrones The Board Game', originally made by reddit user u/moaeater of Melbourne. It was shared via Onedrive with incomplete files and unclear instructions. This repo includes all the additional 3D models I created, as well as clearer instructions so you too can create this unofficial expansion for the game.
