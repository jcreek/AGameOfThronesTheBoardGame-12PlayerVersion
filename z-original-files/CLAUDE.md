This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Game of Thrones-themed board/card game project containing primarily visual assets and game documentation. The repository is organized by the major houses and factions from the Game of Thrones universe.

## Directory Structure

The project contains faction-specific directories, each with character cards and artwork:
- **House Directories**: Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Martell, Tyrell, Targaryen, Blackfyre
- **Other Factions**: Dothraki, Night's Watch, Black & White (Braavos), Qarth
- **Game Resources**: Wildling Cards and Game Mechanics directory
- **3D Models**: .skp files (SketchUp) for game pieces

## File Types

- **Images**: .jpg, .png - Character artwork and backgrounds
- **Design Files**: .psd - Layered Photoshop files for character cards
- **Game Data**: .xlsx - Excel files containing game mechanics and player configurations
- **3D Models**: .skp - SketchUp files for game pieces (barrels, castles, order tokens)
- **Documentation**: .docx, .pdf - Game rules and getting started guides

## Working with Assets

### Image Files
Character cards follow a naming pattern: `[Character Name] Card.psd` with corresponding artwork files

### Excel Files
- `Game of Thrones.xlsx` - Main game data file
- `Game of Thrones 12 Player.xlsx` - Extended player configuration
- Located in root directory

### Design Patterns
Each faction directory typically contains:
- Character artwork (source images)
- Card designs (.psd files)
- Faction symbology/backgrounds
- Front/Back card templates where applicable
