### Week 2-3: Production Sprint

#### ‚ùå SKIP HOME 3D PRINTING - NOT ENOUGH TIME

**Your Bamboo P1S is great BUT:**
- 50-60 hours print time = 7-10 days if running 24/7
- Risk of failures, reprints, filament issues
- You need time for testing the actual game

- [ ] **Calculate Quantities Needed (6 NEW Players Only)**

  - [ ] Order tokens: 15 per player √ó 6 = 90 tokens (match existing sets)
  - [ ] Castle/garrison markers: 4 per player √ó 6 = 24 pieces
  - [ ] Supply barrels: 5 per player √ó 6 = 30 pieces
  - [ ] Power tokens: 20 per player √ó 6 = 120 tokens
  - [ ] Victory/supply markers: 6 additional faction markers
  - [ ] Influence tokens: 6 additional for expanded tracks

- [ ] **Filament & Materials**

  - [ ] Calculate total filament needed (~1.5-2kg for 6 factions)
  - [ ] Order NEW faction-colored filaments:
    - Red/Black (Targaryen - different shade from Lannister)
    - Purple (Blackfyre)
    - Brown/Bronze (Dothraki)
    - Black/White (Night's Watch)
    - White/Grey (Braavos - House of Black & White)
    - Gold/Blue (Qarth)
  - [ ] Order backup filament (add 20% buffer)

  - [ ] Day 1-2: Order tokens for 6 factions (90 pieces)
  - [ ] Day 3: Castle/garrison markers (24 pieces)
  - [ ] Day 4: Supply barrels (30 pieces)
  - [ ] Day 5-6: Power tokens (120 pieces)
