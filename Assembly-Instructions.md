# Assembly Instructions

## 3D Printing

I printed the parts myself using a Bamboo Labs P1S 3D printer. I recommend using PLA filament for ease of printing and good detail. If you don't have a 3D printer, you can use a 3D printing service to have the parts printed and shipped to you. I've never used one so can't make recommendations. The `.stl` files are what you will need to send them.

### Units

Each house needs these printed in their colour (see [the README](./README.md#general-information) for the colours).

- 10 [footmen](./3d-printing/units/footman.stl)
- 5 [knights](./3d-printing/units/knight.stl)
- 6 [ships](./3d-printing/units/ship.stl)
- 2 [siege engines](./3d-printing/units/siege-engine.stl)

### Power Tokens

Each house needs 20 printed in their colour (see [the README](./README.md#general-information) for the colours).

- 20 [power tokens](./3d-printing/other/power-token.stl)

### Influence Tokens

There are tokens needed, three for each House, to represent their standing on the tracks. I have created a simple design for each track, with a symbol embossed into it:

1. [Influence Token 1 (Crown)](./3d-printing/influence/crown-token.stl)
2. [Influence Token 2 (Sword)](./3d-printing/influence/sword-token.stl)
3. [Influence Token 3 (Raven)](./3d-printing/influence/raven-token.stl)

You will need to print one of each, per house, in that house's colour (see [the README](./README.md#general-information) for the colours). That's a total of 12 per token, 36 overall.

### Supply Tokens

Each house needs 1 printed in their colour (see [the README](./README.md#general-information) for the colours).

- 1 [supply token](./3d-printing/other/supply-token.stl)

### Victory Point Tokens

Each house needs 1 printed in their colour (see [the README](./README.md#general-information) for the colours).

- 1 [victory point token](./3d-printing/other/victory-point-token.stl)

### Influence

By changing the board the game is played on we lose the 'Influence' section, which needed updating to work with 12 players anyway. I have created three models based on the designs of the original creator, one for each of the Influence tracks.

1. [Influence Track 1](./3d-printing/influence/board-1.stl)
2. [Influence Track 2](./3d-printing/influence/board-2.stl)
3. [Influence Track 3](./3d-printing/influence/board-3.stl)

You will need to print one of each track.
